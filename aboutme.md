Currently, I am interest in the research agenda of Embodied / Robotics AI. With particular focus pretraining Large Foundational models and finetuning with online RL.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
